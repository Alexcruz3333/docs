## Basenames

## Wallet and Funds

### Smart Wallet Requirement

**The beta requires a smart wallet.** A smart wallet is a passkey-secured, self-custodial onchain wallet that's embedded in the app. It's designed for easy onboarding and better user experienceâ€”no browser extensions, no app switching.

If you don't have a smart wallet, you will create one in the onboarding flow for the new beta app.

### Checking Your Wallet Type

If you use a passkey to sign onchain transactions, you have a smart wallet. If you have a 12-word recovery phrase backed up somewhere, you use an EOA (externally owned account), not a smart wallet.

<Tip>
From the in-app browser, go to wallet.coinbase.com and log in. If you have a smart wallet, you'll see it say "smart wallet" in your account details.
</Tip>

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I logged into the beta, but don't see my funds from Coinbase Wallet.">
The Coinbase Wallet beta currently only supports smart wallets. Your funds are safe and still in Coinbase Wallet. If you created a new smart wallet during the onboarding process, then your previous Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet will only be available in the standard Coinbase Wallet app.

<Info>
You can return to your previous wallet by toggling beta mode off.
Navigate to the Social tab (first icon), tap your profile pic, and toggle "beta mode" off.

## Farcaster Integration

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I connect my Farcaster account?">
Open the social tab and engage with any post (tap like or recast). You'll be prompted to open the Farcaster app to connect your account. Follow the prompts to link Coinbase Wallet to Farcaster.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I don't have a Farcaster account?">
Coinbase Wallet currently does not yet support new Farcaster account creation. If you do not have a Farcaster account, you will need to go to the app store and download Farcaster to sign up for an account. Then follow the "How do I connect my Farcaster account" instructions above to link your accounts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Beta Management

### Toggling Beta Mode

**To turn beta mode off:** Navigate to the Social tab (first icon), tap your profile photo, and toggle "beta mode" off.

**To rejoin beta mode:** Navigate to the Assets tab (last tab on the right), select the settings icon in the upper right, and toggle "Beta mode".

### Additional Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I needed to reinstall Coinbase Wallet and no longer have access to the beta - can I get another invite?">
Unfortunately, our invites are one time use. If you uninstall the app, we aren't able to add you back into the beta. However, all your wallets will still be available as long as you have your passkeys, backups, and recovery phrases.
