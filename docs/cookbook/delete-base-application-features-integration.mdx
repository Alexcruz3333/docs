# Base Application Features

Base provides a comprehensive suite of features designed to create superior blockchain application experiences. Understanding and implementing these features distinguishes professional Mini Apps from basic web applications, providing users with seamless, gas-efficient interactions that feel natural rather than technically burdensome.

Smart Accounts represent a fundamental advancement in blockchain user experience. These universal accounts are powered by the Base App and eliminate the complexity of traditional wallet management for end users. Instead of requiring users to understand private keys, seed phrases, and gas fees, Smart Accounts provide familiar, app-like experiences while maintaining the security and decentralization benefits of blockchain technology.

OnchainKit offers a complete library of prebuilt React components specifically designed for blockchain interactions. These components handle complex blockchain operations behind clean, intuitive interfaces. Rather than building wallet connection flows, transaction signing interfaces, and blockchain data displays from scratch, you can implement battle-tested components that integrate seamlessly with Base infrastructure.

Paymaster functionality enables truly gasless user experiences by allowing your application to sponsor transaction fees. This removes one of the biggest barriers to blockchain adoptionâ€”the need for users to hold cryptocurrency to pay for transactions. Your Mini App can provide smooth, traditional app-like experiences while leveraging blockchain capabilities invisibly.

Batched transactions allow multiple blockchain operations to be grouped under a single user signature. This advanced feature improves user experience by reducing the number of wallet interactions required for complex operations. For example, a token approval and transfer can be combined into a single user action rather than requiring separate confirmations.

I want to implement advanced Base features in my Mini App. Help me create:

SMART ACCOUNT INTEGRATION:
- Set up Smart Account connectivity for seamless user onboarding
- Handle account creation and authentication flows
- Implement universal wallet functionality that works across Base App

ONCHAINKIT COMPONENTS:
- Integrate wallet connection components
- Add transaction signing interfaces
- Implement blockchain data display components
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states

PAYMASTER GASLESS TRANSACTIONS:
- Set up Paymaster API integration
- Create gasless transaction flows for core app functions
- Handle edge cases and fallback scenarios
- Implement transaction status tracking

BATCHED TRANSACTIONS:
- Design approval + transfer batch operations
- Create multi-step transaction flows with single signature
- Optimize gas efficiency and user experience
- Handle partial transaction failures gracefully

Provide complete React/TypeScript code with Base-specific configurations and explain how each feature enhances user experience.
