# What Is the Base App (TBA)?

The Base App (TBA) is your new home onchain—a place where you can post, message, pay, trade, and build. It brings together everything people love about the internet, but without the walls of traditional platforms. And it's built entirely on open protocols, so anyone with an internet connection can join or create.

TBA feels like a familiar social app, but underneath, it's a new kind of operating system for the onchain world. You can create content, earn from it, chat with friends, discover Mini Apps, and even launch your own—all in one place. It’s multiplayer by default and designed for everyday people, not just crypto pros.

Creators can earn directly from their posts through "coined content," where likes, shares, and interactions come with real upside. App developers can publish Mini Apps that are instantly discoverable in the social feed and inside chat. And users get a universal wallet, human-readable identity (Basenames), and gasless payments from the start.

TBA isn’t just a product—it’s a protocol anyone can build on. You own your content, your apps, and your relationships. No gatekeepers, no downloads, no limits.
