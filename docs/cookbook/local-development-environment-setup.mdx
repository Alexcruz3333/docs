# Local Development Environment Setup

Vibe coding tools are great for getting a web app online fast—but they don’t always understand onchain development yet. That’s why it’s important to know how to set up and work in a local environment. This way, you can download code from these tools, make blockchain-specific changes, and test everything yourself.

If you’re starting from scratch locally, the process is straightforward. Open [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/what-is-terminal-trmld4c92d55/mac) on your computer and run:

```bash
npx create-onchain --mini
```

This uses MiniKit to scaffold a Next.js project with wallet integration, social feed support, and identity features already set up. Once that’s done, you can open the project in an AI-powered IDE like Cursor or Claude Code to continue building.

> **Tip:** Only run `npx create-onchain --mini` when starting locally—not in an online editor or vibe coding tool.

## Understanding the Folder Structure

A clear folder structure makes your app easier to work on and share. Here’s a common Next.js setup for a Mini App:

```
my-miniapp/
├── app/ # Main application pages
│ ├── layout.tsx # App layout
│ └── page.tsx # Default homepage
├── components/ # Reusable UI components
├── public/ # Static assets (images, icons)
├── styles/ # Global and component styles
├── utils/ # Helper functions
├── llms.txt # AI-friendly doc for your project
├── plan.md # Your project planning notes
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Placing `llms.txt` and `plan.md` in the root makes it easier for AI tools to understand your project and goals.

## Running Your App Locally

Run the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to see your Mini App. Your Mini App will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make will update in real-time—perfect for testing and iterating quickly.

## Deploying to Vercel

When your app is ready to share, you can deploy it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) from the command line:

```
vercel
```

or use the `--prod` flag to deploy to the production environment which is required for sharing it to TBA and Farcaster.

```
vercel --prod
```

This will give you a live, shareable link. Remember to configure environment variables for any API keys or secrets before deploying.

## Example Prompt for AI Code Editors

If you’re working in an AI IDE like Cursor or Claude Code, here’s an example of a prompt you can use to guide setup and workflow:

```
I want to set up a Mini App development environment from scratch. Guide me through:

## SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

- Install MiniKit and create a new project
- Understand the project folder structure
- Set up local development workflow
- Configure deployment to Vercel

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:

- How to run the app locally
- Where to add custom components
- How to test wallet connections locally
- Best practices for organizing code

## DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:

- Prepare the app for production
- Deploy using Vercel CLI
- Set up environment variables
- Test the deployed application

Provide step-by-step instructions with exact commands I should run and explain what each step accomplishes.
```
