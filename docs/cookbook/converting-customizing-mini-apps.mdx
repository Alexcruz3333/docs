# Make Your Web App a Mini App

You have a clean frontend. Now turn it into a Mini App. Vibe coding tools are great for UI, but they do not yet handle onchain pieces perfectly. Download your code, open it in Cursor or Claude Code, and add MiniKit to enable Smart Wallet, gasless transactions, and Base App integration.

<Tip>
  Before you prompt your AI IDE, list where you want onchain interactions to
  happen. Examples: mint a collectible from the Create screen, tip from the
  Feed, swap on the Trade screen. This helps the AI place MiniKit components in
  the right files.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title='Open your project in an AI IDE'>
    Launch Cursor or Claude Code and open your Next.js project. Ensure it runs
    locally first with <code>npm run dev</code> so the AI can follow a working
    baseline.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Provide docs context to the AI'>
    Use the MiniKit existing-app integration page. Use the site dropdown to
    “Copy page as Markdown for LLMs”, then paste that markdown into your AI IDE
    as context.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Ask the AI to analyze your app'>
    Have the AI map your routes, layout, and component structure. Ask it to
    propose exact integration points for MiniKit provider and hooks.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Integrate MiniKit provider and Smart Wallet'>
    Add the MiniKit provider in <code>app/layout.tsx</code> (or your top-level
    layout), wire basic hooks, and confirm no “login” button is added. Mini Apps
    should feel native and sessionless.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add Paymaster for gasless UX'>
    Configure Coinbase Developer Platform Paymaster with environment variables.
    Update your action flows to sponsor transactions, then test locally.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Verify and commit'>
    Run your app, test every onchain touchpoint, and commit changes with clear
    messages. You are ready to deploy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI Analysis Prompt (for Cursor or Claude Code)

Paste this into your AI IDE. Replace bracketed parts with your details. Include the MiniKit “existing app integration” markdown from docs.base.org as an additional message.

```
You are assisting me in converting a downloaded Next.js app into a Mini App for the Base App (TBA).

ANALYZE THE PROJECT

Inspect my Next.js structure (app/, components/, utils/) and identify the best integration points for:

MiniKit provider in app/layout.tsx

Smart Wallet setup

Any hooks needed to access Base App context

List every file you plan to modify and why.

INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

Use MiniKit as per the docs I will paste.

Use Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Paymaster for gasless transactions.

Use Smart Wallet.

Do NOT create a login button.

Keep the current routing and UI intact.

ONCHAIN TOUCHPOINTS IN MY APP

I want onchain interactions in these places:
[Describe screens and actions, e.g., Create screen: mint item; Feed: tip creator; Trade: swap token]

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Propose exact code changes with file paths and code blocks.

- Add required env vars and tell me where to put them (.env.local).
- Update any server actions or API routes needed to call Paymaster safely.

VALIDATION

Provide a test checklist to verify:
- Provider mounts without errors
- Smart Wallet available

Paymaster sponsoring a sample transaction

No login button rendered

Include troubleshooting tips for common issues (env vars, build errors, missing providers).

Now request any files you need to see to proceed, and confirm assumptions before editing.
```

<Tip>
  Docs import shortcut: on the MiniKit “Existing app integration” page, use the
  dropdown to “Copy page as Markdown for LLMs” and paste it directly into your
  AI chat. This gives the model precise instructions and reduces hallucinations.
</Tip>

## Converting Existing Applications to Mini Apps

Converting a traditional web app means adding MiniKit and Paymaster without breaking your current flows.

- Analyze current auth and state so the AI can place provider code cleanly.
- Add OnchainKit or MiniKit UI where onchain actions live, not everywhere.
- Configure Paymaster so key actions are gasless.
- Keep UX consistent with your existing design system.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Clone and audit'>
    Clone your repo and note routes, shared layouts, and key components.
    Identify where onchain actions should live.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Integrate MiniKit'>
    Add provider, hooks, and environment variables. Keep your existing UI and
    component hierarchy.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Enable gasless with Paymaster'>
    Configure CDP keys locally, implement sponsorship for target actions, and
    test.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Deploy and verify'>
    Deploy with Vercel, test on production URL, and verify Mini App behavior
    within Base App context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```

## Fork, Customize and Deploy

Forking a reference Mini App can save time, then you can layer in your specific flows and branding.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Fork a relevant starter'>
    Choose an example close to your use case. Update{' '}
    <code>miniapp.config.json</code> metadata and environment variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Customize UI and contracts'>
    Adjust theme tokens, copy, and any contract addresses or endpoints required
    for your flows.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Deploy and verify in Base App'>
    Deploy with Vercel, test sharing and discovery, and validate wallet and
    Paymaster flows end to end.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```
