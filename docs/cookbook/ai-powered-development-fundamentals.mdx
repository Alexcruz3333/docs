# How Do We Build Mini Apps?

Mini Apps are just web apps—with added capabilities. If you’ve built a website, you’re already halfway there. The difference is that Mini Apps are designed to work seamlessly inside social feeds, come with built-in wallets, and connect to open, onchain identity.

The easiest way to get started is with MiniKit, a toolkit that gives you ready-to-go templates. These templates handle the heavy lifting—wallet integration, social feed support, and identity management—so you can focus on what your app actually does.

You can also build using AI tools that turn ideas into code. Tools like [Vercel V0](https://v0.dev/), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), and [Loveable](https://lovable.dev/) let you describe your app in plain language and generate working code in minutes. They’re perfect for creators, vibe coders, and anyone who wants to build without spending weeks learning a new framework.

In this guide, we’ll use AI to help build a Mini App that also works as a standalone website. That means what you build can live on Base, show up in TBA, and still work on the open web.
