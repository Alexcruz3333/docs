# Mastering AI Prompt Engineering

Now that you understand what Mini Apps are and how they show up in the Base App (TBA), it’s time to actually build. But here’s the twist: you don’t need to be a traditional developer. The skill that matters most as a vibe coder is knowing how to _talk to AI_.

Think of prompt writing as your creative toolset. It's how you’ll describe your ideas, design your interface, and even generate functional app logic. In this section, we’ll show you how to write better prompts, avoid common pitfalls, and start building your first Mini App—with help from tools like Vercel V0, Claude Code, and Loveable.

Let’s start by understanding what makes a great prompt, and walk through an improved template for getting started.

# AI Prompt Template for Getting Started

Use the following prompt to generate the first version of your Mini App UI and logic:

```
I want to build a Mini App for the Base App (TBA)—a social platform where users can post, trade, message, and earn. Please create a responsive React component that includes:

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

[Briefly describe your app's purpose, e.g., "a mood tracker that lets users log their feelings and share their vibe"]

[List 2–3 features the app should include, like: mood selection, daily recap, emoji reactions]

[Mention if the app needs to store or display any user data]

TECH REQUIREMENTS:

Use React with TypeScript

Integrate wallet connection using MiniKit SDK

Allow users to post to the TBA social feed

Use Tailwind CSS for styling

Ensure it's mobile-responsive

VISUAL STYLE:

Clean, modern design

[Optional: Specify colors or mood — e.g., "calming blues and purples"]

Include clear call-to-action buttons

Optimize layout for mobile users

SOCIAL FEATURES:

Show user’s Basename if connected

Let users react to each other’s posts (e.g., emoji or stickers)

Enable easy sharing or reposting

Please return complete, working code with clear comments that explain each part.
```

# Prompting for Best Results

Prompting well is a core skill—it unlocks faster results, better apps, and more creativity. Here’s how to improve:

- **Start with a clear goal.** Be specific about what the app should do, who it’s for, and how users will interact with it.
- **Give context.** Tell the AI what platform you're building for (TBA), what tools you're using (MiniKit, React, Tailwind), and what kind of experience you want to create.
- **Iterate in small steps.** Don’t try to get everything perfect in one go. Run your prompt, review the output, and refine your request to get closer to your vision.
- **Use `llms.txt` files.** These are AI-friendly docs provided by many blockchain tools. Including their contents (or linking to them) gives the AI better reference data.
- **Read your prompt out loud.** If it sounds confusing to you, it’ll confuse the AI too.
- **Save good prompts.** Treat them like building blocks. You’ll reuse them across projects.
