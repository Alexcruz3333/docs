# Introduction to Mini Apps

Mini Apps are a new way to build and share apps—designed for the internet we actually use today: fast, social, and always on. They're not "mini" because they're small in impact, but because they’re lightweight, easy to create, and instantly accessible.

Instead of requiring users to download a full app or sign up for a new account, Mini Apps work directly inside the Base App. That means someone can open your app from a social feed, use it immediately, and share it with friends—all in one flow. Whether it's a poll, a marketplace, or a game, Mini Apps are designed to spread through networks, not app stores.

They also come with powerful features out of the box: decentralized identity, built-in payments, and seamless social connection. You don’t need to worry about distribution rules or platform lock-in. Your app lives on open infrastructure—and your users own their experience.
