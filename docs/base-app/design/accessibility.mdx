# Accessibility

Design for everyone. Follow these requirements to pass the Quality Bar and deliver inclusive experiences.

## Safe areas and touch targets

- Use `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for padding
- Minimum touch target: 44×44 px
- Avoid placing controls near home indicator edges

```css
.app {
  padding: env(safe-area-inset-top) env(safe-area-inset-right) env(
      safe-area-inset-bottom
    ) env(safe-area-inset-left);
}
.button {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
}
```

## Color and contrast

- Meet WCAG AA contrast (≥ 4.5:1 for body text)
- Do not convey meaning by color alone; pair with icons/labels
- Provide light/dark themes and preserve contrast in both

## Typography

- Base size ≥ 16px; avoid ultra‑light weights
- Maintain readable line length (45–75 characters)
- Respect user font size settings when possible

## Motion and reduced motion

- Keep transitions 200–300ms; no gratuitous motion
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Semantics and roles

- Use semantic HTML (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `h1`–`h3`)
- Provide `aria-label` for icon‑only buttons
- Ensure focus outlines are visible and not removed

```tsx
<button aria-label="Close dialog">
  <Icon name="close" />
</button>
```

## Keyboard and focus management

- Trap focus within modals; return focus to trigger on close
- Visible focus state for all interactive elements
- Order focus logically (DOM order matches visual order)

## Error messaging

- Use clear language; describe cause and next step
- Link errors to fields via `aria-describedby`
- Do not rely solely on color to indicate errors

## Media and images

- Provide `alt` text for informative images
- Mark decorative images with empty `alt=""`
- Caption essential videos; provide transcripts when applicable

## Accessibility checklist

- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44px; safe areas respected
- [ ] Contrast ≥ 4.5:1; legible in light and dark
- [ ] Reduced motion honored; no blocking animations
- [ ] Semantic elements and ARIA where needed
- [ ] Focus visible and managed in modals
- [ ] Clear, actionable error messages
- [ ] Images have appropriate alt text
