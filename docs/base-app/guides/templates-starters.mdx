# Templates & Starters

Kickstart development with opinionated starters that meet the Quality Bar.

## Browse‑first (no auth)

Includes:

- First‑run value screen
- List/detail with skeletons and empty states
- Optional personalization panel

## Action‑gated auth

Includes:

- Value first, auth prompt second with reason and benefits
- Graceful decline path and demo mode
- Optimistic actions with undo

## Game loop

Includes:

- Daily streaks and rewards
- Lightweight animations (200–300ms)
- Offline‑tolerant caching of progress

Each starter ships with:

- Safe‑area CSS tokens and layout grid
- Copy rules and banned‑terms linter config
- Image pipeline (sharp/imagemin) with byte caps

Install via CLI (coming soon):

```bash
npx create-base-mini-app
```

## Local starter examples

The repository includes three minimal starters under `starters/`:

- `starters/browse-first`
- `starters/action-gated`
- `starters/game-loop`

Run locally:

```bash
cd starters/browse-first && npm install && npm run dev
```
