# Quality Bar Checklist

This checklist defines the mandatory quality standards that all Base MiniApps must meet before publishing and to be eligible for featuring. These standards ensure a consistent, high-quality user experience across the Base App ecosystem.

<Warning>
**Required for Featuring**

All items in this checklist must be completed and verified before your mini app is eligible for featuring in the Base App carousel or categories.

</Warning>

## Pre-Launch Quality Requirements

### ✅ Clarity & First Impression

- [ ] **Value Proposition**: First screen states app value in ≤ 80 characters
- [ ] **No Jargon**: First two screens contain no crypto jargon or technical terms
- [ ] **Clear Purpose**: Users understand what the app does within 5 seconds of opening

### ✅ Guest-First Experience

- [ ] **Browse Without Auth**: Users can explore core functionality without signing in
- [ ] **Deferred Authentication**: Auth is only required when user attempts an action that needs it
- [ ] **Guest Path Available**: Provide "Continue as guest" or browse-only mode where possible
- [ ] **Auth Reasoning**: When auth is required, clearly explain why with user-friendly language

### ✅ Performance Standards

- [ ] **Load Time**: First interaction available ≤ 1.5 seconds on mid-range devices
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Initial JavaScript ≤ 200 KB (gzipped)
- [ ] **Image Budget**: First-screen images ≤ 300 KB total
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals**:
  - Time to Interactive (TTI) ≤ 200ms
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≈ 0
  - 60 fps on key transitions

### ✅ Asset Specifications

- [ ] **App Icon**: 512×512 PNG/JPG ≤ 60 KB (source 1024×1024 allowed)
- [ ] **Splash Image**: 200×200 PNG/JPG ≤ 40 KB with solid background color
- [ ] **Hero Image** (if featuring): 1200×628 PNG/JPG ≤ 250 KB
- [ ] **Screenshots**: Up to 3 images, ≤ 500 KB each
- [ ] **Open Graph**: 1200×630 PNG/JPG ≤ 250 KB

### ✅ Layout & Accessibility

- [ ] **Safe Areas**: Respect iOS safe areas using `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ≥ 44px minimum
- [ ] **Text Legibility**: All text ≥ 15pt equivalent with high contrast
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on both iPhone and Android screen sizes
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Supports both light and dark Base App themes

### ✅ UI States & Error Handling

- [ ] **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for loading content (no blank screens)
- [ ] **Empty States**: Clear guidance when no content is available
- [ ] **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- [ ] **Offline Handling**: Graceful degradation when network is unavailable
- [ ] **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation when actions complete successfully

### ✅ Content & Copy Standards

- [ ] **Brand Consistency**: References "Base app" (not "Farcaster" or other platforms)
- [ ] **No Crypto Jargon**: Avoid "connect wallet", "sign message", "seed phrase" in UI
- [ ] **Outcome-Oriented CTAs**: Button text describes what happens ("Start Quiz" not "Connect")
- [ ] **Sentence Case**: Use sentence case for all UI text (not Title Case)
- [ ] **Plain English**: All microcopy uses clear, non-technical language

### ✅ Error Taxonomy & Reliability

- [ ] **Standardized Errors**: Use consistent error categories (network, auth, validation, etc.)
- [ ] **User-Friendly Messages**: All error messages explain what happened and next steps
- [ ] **Telemetry**: Track key metrics (auth success rate, load time, error rates)
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for network failures

### ✅ Manifest & Configuration

- [ ] **Valid Schema**: Manifest passes validation with correct structure
- [ ] **Testing Mode**: Set `"noindex": true` during development and testing
- [ ] **Correct Categories**: App is in appropriate category with relevant tags (≤ 5 tags)
- [ ] **Complete Metadata**: All required fields populated with accurate information

### ✅ Privacy & Permissions

- [ ] **Contextual Permissions**: Request permissions only when needed for specific actions
- [ ] **Clear Reasoning**: Explain why permissions are needed in user-friendly terms
- [ ] **Minimal Data**: Only collect data necessary for app functionality
- [ ] **Transparent Usage**: Clear about how user data will be used

## Validation Tools

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Device Testing**: Test on both iOS and Android devices
2. **Network Conditions**: Test on 3G, WiFi, and offline scenarios
3. **Theme Testing**: Verify appearance in light and dark modes
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with empty data, long text, and error conditions

### Automated Validation

Use the Base MiniKit CLI tools for automated checks:

```bash
# Validate manifest and assets
mini-kit doctor

# Check copy for banned terms
mini-kit lint-copy

# Performance audit
mini-kit lighthouse
```

### Pre-Submission Requirements

Before submitting for featuring consideration:

1. **Complete this checklist** with all items verified
2. **Record a Loom walkthrough** (≤ 2 minutes) showing key user flows
3. **Generate Lighthouse report** using mobile profile in webview
