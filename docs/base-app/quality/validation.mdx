# Validation

Use these tools to verify your MiniApp meets requirements.

## CLI

```bash
mini-kit doctor         # schema, assets, categories, budgets
mini-kit lint-copy      # banned terms and CTA rules
mini-kit lighthouse     # mobile profile inside webview harness
```

## Manual checks

- Test iOS and Android devices
- Light and dark themes
- 3G, Wi‑Fi, offline
- Error states, retries, and guest mode flows

## CI example (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: Validate MiniApp
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: "18" }
      - run: npm i -g @base/minikit-cli
      - run: mini-kit doctor --strict
      - run: mini-kit lint-copy
```

## Pass criteria

- Quality Checklist: all items checked
- Budgets: within limits (JS, images, TBT, CLS)
- Copy: no banned terms; outcome‑oriented CTAs
- Assets: dimensions and byte caps match spec
