title: "Sub Accounts"
---

Sub Accounts are hierarchical, app-specific accounts that extend from a user's primary Smart Wallet. Each Sub Account operates as a distinct account that can:

- Execute transactions and sign messages
- Maintain separate asset management
- Be fully controlled by both the universal Smart Wallet and authorized application logic

## Technical Details

- Smart Wallet Ownership: The user's Smart Wallet acts as an owner of the Sub Account, allowing it to manage assets on the Sub Account and make calls from it.
- App-Signer Agnostic: Sub Accounts are designed to be agnostic to whatever signing software an app wants to use: whether in-browser CryptoKey or server signers from teams like Privy or Turnkey.
- When an app requests a Sub Account creation and the user approves, all future signing and transaction requests will use the Sub Account.

Refer to the [Implementation Guide](/smart-wallet/guides/sub-accounts) or the [Technical Reference](/smart-wallet/technical-reference/sdk/sub-account-reference) for more details on how to create and manage Sub Accounts.
