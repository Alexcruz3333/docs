The template wires up core MiniKit pieces so you can ship v0 fast.

## Providers and initialization

- `MiniKitProvider` wraps your app, configures wagmi and react-query, and applies safe area insets.
- `useMiniKit` handles initialization and provides `setFrameReady()`.

## Buttons and actions

- Save Frame: uses `useAddFrame()` to let users save your Mini App and returns a `url` and `token` for notifications.
- External links: `useOpenUrl()` opens URLs within or outside a frame context.
- Close: `useClose()` dismisses the frame.
