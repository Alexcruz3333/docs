title: Base App Compatibility
description: Which Mini App features are supported in Base App (TBA) today
---

Base App is working towards full compatibility with the Farcaster Mini App SDK. During beta, some features are not yet supported.

## Currently Unsupported (examples)

- Environment detection: `sdk.isInMiniApp()` (ETA 8/6)
- Haptic feedback methods: `sdk.haptics.*` (ETA 8/13)
- Token actions: `sdk.actions.swapToken()` (ETA 8/6)
- Notifications: not yet supported
- Mini App actions: `.addMiniApp()`, `.requestCameraAndMicrophoneAccess()` (ETA 8/13)

## Wallet Interactions

- `sdk.actions.getEthereumProvider()` — Base App exposes an EIP‑1193 provider; use MiniKit/Wagmi or window provider detection.

## Navigation & Links

- Avoid direct Farcaster/warpcast intent URLs; use SDK actions like `composeCast()`
- For external links, prefer `openUrl()` over raw anchors

## Supported Chains

Base, Mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Zora, BNB, Avalanche C‑Chain

## Development Notes

- Use `openUrl()` for external navigation
- Use `composeCast()` instead of composer URLs
- Provide alternatives for haptic feedback
- Avoid relying on location context for core flows
- To detect Base App, check `context.client.clientFid` (Base App: `309857`)

We are actively expanding compatibility and will update this page as support increases.
