## Search

### How Search Works
Users discover Mini Apps through direct search queries in Base App.

<Frame caption="Here in The Base App you can see searching based on partial titles">
<img src="/images/minikit/search.jpg" alt="search bar in base app" height="200"/>
</Frame>

Your Mini App will only appear in search results after it has been indexed. To ensure indexing, share your Mini App at least once in Base App. Indexing typically takes ~10 minutes after the first share.

### Managing Search Indexing

Development Environment: add `"noindex": true` to prevent dev/staging from appearing in search. Remove or set false for production.

**Removing from Search:**
To remove your Mini App from search results, invalidate your manifest (removes from all discovery).

<Warning>
If your Mini App does not show in search please follow the debugging guide [here](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/common-issues#1-app-discovery--indexing-issues)
</Warning>

## Discovery Surfaces

### App Categories

<Warning>
Choose your primaryCategory carefully as it determines where your app appears in Base App's category browsing.
</Warning>

<Tip> The Base app uses aggregated data (7-day rolling window) to generate dynamic category rankings and identify trending applications.</Tip>
