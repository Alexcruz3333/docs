## Authentication guidance from Base App

<Warning>
Save authentication that requires an interaction for interactions that require it (e.g., buying something, viewing personalized pages).
</Warning>

Supported approaches:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Sign In with Farcaster / Quick Auth">
Base App supports SIWF in‑app, enabling social identity without leaving the app. Quick Auth can issue a JWT to persist session state.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Wallet Auth">
Base App provides an in‑app smart wallet. Use wallet auth for a persisted session when necessary, but avoid gating initial exploration behind connect.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Context Data">
All hosts return context data (including user). Use it for analytics or lightweight session hints, but do not treat as primary auth.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Best practices:

- Gate wallet only at the point of onchain action
- Prefer SIWF/Quick Auth for low‑friction identity
- Use context for analytics; avoid using it as primary auth
