Users access your mini apps on mobile, therefore it's crucial that your mini app is designed with mobile-first experience in mind. 

Key considerations:

**Visual hierarchy and readability**
- Use legible font sizes, line heights, and adequate contrast for small screens.
- Help people concentrate on primary tasks and content by limiting the number of onscreen controls while making secondary details and actions discoverable with minimal interaction.

**Navigation and responsiveness**
- Use tab navigation to simplify movement within the app.
- Ensure layouts adjust smoothly to various screen sizes and orientations.
- Design for vertical scrolling rather than horizontal, as itâ€™s more natural on mobile.
