### Mobile-first
- Use legible font sizes, line heights, and adequate contrast for small screens.
- Help people concentrate on primary tasks and content by limiting the number of onscreen controls while making secondary details and actions discoverable with minimal interaction.
- Use tab navigation to simplify movement within the app.
- Ensure layouts adjust smoothly to various screen sizes and orientations.
- Design for vertical scrolling rather than horizontal, as itâ€™s more natural on mobile.

### Complete metadata
Ensure your mini app includes complete and compliant metadata to maximize its discoverability on Base. Always validate your metadata using the [Base Mini App Playground](base.dev/mini-app-playground) before publishing.

### Gasless transactions
Enable users to transact on your apps without needing gas by using wallet solutions that support gas sponsorship like [Base Account and Paymaster](/base-account/improve-ux/sponsor-gas/paymasters).

### Legible identity
Never use wallet addresses. Instead, leverage identity solutions like ENS and [Basenames](/base-account/basenames/basenames-onchainkit-tutorial).
