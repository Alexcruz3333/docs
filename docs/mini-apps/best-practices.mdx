### Mobile-first
- Choose readable font sizes, comfortable line spacing, and strong color contrast for small displays.
- Prioritize core tasks and content by keeping onscreen controls minimal, surfacing secondary actions only when needed.
- Implement tab navigation to streamline in-app movement.
- Optimize layouts to adapt fluidly across screen sizes and orientations.
- Favor vertical scrolling over horizontal for a more intuitive mobile experience

### Complete metadata
Ensure your mini app includes complete and compliant metadata to maximize its discoverability on Base. Always validate your metadata using the [Base Mini App Playground](base.dev/mini-app-playground) before publishing.

### Gasless transactions
Enable users to transact on your apps without needing gas by using wallet solutions that support gas sponsorship like [Base Account and Paymaster](/base-account/improve-ux/sponsor-gas/paymasters).

### Legible identity
Never display wallet addresses as default usernames. Instead, leverage identity solutions like ENS and [Basenames](/base-account/basenames/basenames-onchainkit-tutorial).
